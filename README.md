Development Process 
-------------------


- The first step was to decide the libraries that are going to be used along with this project, in my first draft the required libraries are:
 - bower: Dependency grabber to manage the javascript libraries.
 - jquery: Framework for dom manipulation and util ajax functions.
 - knockoutJS: MVVM framework for the application.
 - underscore: For JavaScript utility methods.
 - bootstrap: Framework for response development.
